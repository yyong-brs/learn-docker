# 第二章 了解 Docker 并运行 Hello World

It’s time to get hands-on with Docker. In this chapter you’ll get lots of experience
with the core feature of Docker: running applications in containers. I’ll also cover
some background that will help you understand exactly what a container is, and
why containers are such a lightweight way to run apps. Mostly you’ll be following
try-it-now exercises, running simple commands to get a feel for this new way of
working with applications.

## 2.1 运行 Hello World 容器

Let’s get started with Docker the same way we would with any new computing con-
cept: running Hello World. You have Docker up and running from chapter 1, so
open your favorite terminal—that could be Terminal on the Mac or a Bash shell on
Linux, and I recommend PowerShell in Windows.

You’re going to send a command to Docker, telling it to run a container that
prints out some simple “Hello, World” text.

<b>TRY IT NOW</b> Enter this command, which will run the Hello World container:

`docker container run diamol/ch02-hello-diamol`
