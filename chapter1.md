# 第一章 开始之前

Docker is a platform for running applications in lightweight units called containers.
Containers have taken hold in software everywhere, from serverless functions in
the cloud to strategic planning in the enterprise. Docker is becoming a core competency for operators and developers across the industry—in the 2019 Stack
Overflow survey, Docker polled as people’s number one “most wanted” technology
(http://mng.bz/04lW).

 And Docker is a simple technology to learn. You can pick up this book as a complete beginner, and you’ll be running containers in chapter 2 and packaging applications to run in Docker in chapter 3. Each chapter focuses on practical tasks, with
examples and labs that work on any machine that runs Docker—Windows, Mac,
and Linux users are all welcome here.

 The journey you’ll follow in this book has been honed over the many years I’ve
been teaching Docker. Every chapter is hands-on—except this one. Before you start
learning Docker, it’s important to understand just how containers are being used in
the real world and the type of problems they solve—that’s what I’ll cover here. This
chapter also describes how I’ll be teaching Docker, so you can figure out if this is
the right book for you. 

 Now let’s look at what people are doing with containers—I’ll cover the five main
scenarios where organizations are seeing huge success with Docker. You’ll see the
wide range of problems you can solve with containers, some of which will certainly
map to scenarios in your own work. By the end of this chapter you’ll understand
why Docker is a technology you need to know, and you’ll see how this book will get
you there.
